Firstly, an apprenticeship  program is one of the best investments a firm can make - U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that companies with apprenticeship programs earnt a return on investment of $1.46 for each dollar invested.  That is an average - in some sectors the ROI has been estimated at as much as $11 for every dollar invested !   Apprenticeship programs also provide employers with opportunities to improve workplace productivity, improve workforce diversity and build a pipeline of workers with the precise skills needed in your workplace (now and into the future). They can help shape the employee to your workplace culture and can strengthen your brand as an employer of choice; and finally boost employee retention.   #apprenticeship Watch:       \u2026see more"}

But, I haven't written about adult non-compliance (yet).  What are we thinking?  Is it the same thinking that let's us think that there was massive election fraud that accounts for the Trump loss?

Is helping someone cope with death coddling?  Is helping someone deal with uncertainty coddling?  Answers: NO.   Podcast probes the content of my new book: Trauma Doesn't Stop at the School Door.

Gamblers know that.  So, after pointing out the non-homogenous nature of higher ed and the absence of consistent change, I suggested that it was vastly better to provide conjectures rather than predictions.  The world is changing so fast; we\u2019re in unknown territory.  I suspect we don\u2019t have all the data and what data we have may be flawed. It is for these very reasons that we feel anxious and stressed and a tad (or more) out of sorts. We have no control; we have no gold at the end of the rainbow; we have an absence of certainty.  And it\u2019s not like the messaging from our governments is consistent. The inability to predict is actually our problem. We can\u2019t and therein lies the disquiet.  So, in response to the editor\u2019s questions, I won\u2019t make predictions. Instead, I\u2019ll conjecture.  Watch for a later  post where I conjecture about higher ed.

Final paragraph tells all.  Post: I'm wondering whether, if we put on a different lens, we'd see another option here. This is to suggest, assuming testing of high quality, that schools/ colleges reopen in Jan. 2021. And, there could be a soft launch in Fall 2020 for some students in small pods who want/need to be in school/college and for whom in person learning is key. The \"Covid-Pod\" approach would have different kinds of educational offerings -- everything from mini classes to pop ups. Here's the acid test: I was asked recently by a colleague: Were I still a college president, would I open in Fall 2020,  having engaged in a myriad of discussions? Honest answer: NO.  I would feel opening in a small town w/o sufficient medical facilities to handle 200 Covid cases quickly in a new peak and poor rural transport (no train or plane w/in an hour) and faculty/staff traveling from big distances presents too big a risk. I wouldn't want to increase the extant possibility of death.

How one expresses that honesty is a different issue. 2.  Do activities at start of class to lower autonomic nervous system; these should involve the senses. 3.  Consider pop-up courses for older students (short courses; small groups) and accurate activities on viruses for younger students.   Some pop up course suggestions: a) What is a pandemic (note word panic w/in it) and when have they occurred in US?; b) Are masks helpful in preventing disease spread; if so, for whom?; and c) Is quarantine the best strategy for disease containment? What does quarantine entail?  For younger students, consider these activities: a) Draw what viruses (any virus) looks like to you? Draw how it looks for real under microscope? Color images; b) What are vaccines and who creates them?  List current vaccines.  Note these topics don\u2019t address COVID-19 virus head on; that\u2019s purposeful.

With the upcoming Parkland shooting anniversary on Feb. 14, we should all pause to reflect on what would produce healing that day as opposed to reactivation of our autonomic nervous systems.

The point was this expanded role actually saved time and money and enabled improved patient care.  Motto was no longer \u201cup (into hospital bed) or out (leaving ER).  There was connection and intervention.  And it improved revisits by 50%.     In my new book, Trauma Does Not Stop at the School Door, I make a similar argument about educators.

But ask:  Isn\u2019t the goal of educators to enable student success?  Isn\u2019t the role of ER personnel to enable patient health?

I have not focused -- until now -- on trauma within the school caused by school personnel. Yes, I have observed teachers/professors causing non-physical trauma through poor pedagogy and demeaning words/acts, and I am well aware, sadly, of sexual assaults by school/university personal on a student. But, now I think I need to focus more attention, sadly, on physical trauma within schools.  It is not between students; it is not bullying student-to-student; those are bad enough. It is teachers/aides/guards assaulting students and causing harm \u2014physical and psychological.  All I can say is that creating trauma responsive schools is critical and stopping trauma on students by adults in schools must stop.  No question about that. We need schools to be places that foster truth and trust.  We need both.  When assaults on students occur by professionals within schools, trust is destroyed.

Reading can literally touch your heart -- so can words.  I just finished Delia Owens moving story, Where the Crawdads Sing.  Kya, the protagonist, learns to read late in her childhood and remarks after reading a poem something to this effect, \"Who knew words could carry such power?\".    I raise this for two reasons today.  Words have power, both positive and negative.  We relish the positive words and the enormous power evoked in us through them. But, we also have negative and discriminatory words and hurtful words (oft-times said in times of anger or in bullying or in a show of power).   These words have power too.   I'd suggest we look more carefully at all our words, starting with our leaders and political candidates and politicians.   We need to be careful. Words aren't just letters strung together.  Repeat: words are not just letters strung together.  They can hurt like weapons, causing psychic injury, and they can make one's heart leap with joy.

Complex to do, especially when swimming upstream against a culture that seems to tolerate bad acts. But, enough already.

This book is English/Spanish.  And, it has other key features: it is on indestructible paper so it can be used by several classes and wiped clean and with very young children (sort of like cloth books in my era or board books but better); it is a book that can and should be read and re-read and it works in a circle in a sense, playing hide and seek again and again.  It has tips for adult readers to enable them to enhance the reading with their children/students/ friends/relatives.

Read recent article in Boston Globe.  All this brought me to realize a strategy that would have worked for Southern Vermont College and some other colleges in distress.  The idea:  right size them.   Could write more but for now: With impending and evident enrollment declines, shrink the spending side to match enrollment until new enrollment approaches are in place.  Yes.  Downsize in the near term.   That would cost some jobs within faculty and staff.  At SVC, I would have torn down old dorms which would cut costs and staffing.  I would have doubled up in new dorm on two floors and rented space for overflow.  I would have had a lean mean administrative team.  (Another leader bloated it for several years with outsized salaries.) Right sizing is hard but smart.  Look at Sterling College.  If past growth isn\u2019t sustainable, adjust and fast.  Don\u2019t bleed to death or ask trustees for repeated end of year shortfall bailouts. Goodness knows, Higher Ed needs to get smarter. Right sizing is smart and doable.

There are approaches, including a very recent study on suicide prevention tied into doctors who see Veterans within the year before death.   I am finishing Shulkin\u2019s new book and am deeply struck by how much his vision of his tenure differs from reality.  As with many leaders who fail, he has not been able to own his mistakes, at least as of page 215 in the book.  Isn\u2019t that tragic too?  He tells a tale in the name of Veterans but so far it is a book justifying his own behaviors.  Sure, politics is a tough game but the story Shulkin tells seems remarkably self serving.   I worry about our saying we are helping when we are really real aggrandizing or self enriching or self promoting.  Leaders committed to being in service to others focus on these others.   On this Veterans Day, it is good to remember what it means to serve \u2014 and we can serve in many ways.... and we can honor service and we can help Veterans when they leave service.

What happens is that children are silenced by the trauma and can\u2019t speak up and out. The freeze response to trauma freezes our voice.  We then have children who hold their trauma within.  That is why I wrote a forthcoming book published by Columbia Teachers College Press (June 2020) titled Educating for Trauma: Strategies for Student Success.  Kids bring their trauma to school in suitcases of different sizes.  We need to help them now.  Waiting does not make trauma disappear. No indeed.  It just gets sublimated and cabined away.  Its symptomology remains.  The book will, I hope, help.       \u2026see more"}

Free throws were not made, tightness set in and shots made earlier did not fall and Georgetown buckled down and hit their shots. Here's what this shows me:  The Mount has a stunningly good coach; their Mount players will be doing 100's of free throw drills today; the Mount players will augment training for endurance play; and they will practice 1 minute drills again and again.  As to GT, they can come back like this on a team that is unranked.  But it is not an ideal strategy for sure for the long season ahead. And seeing Patrick Ewing coach: amazing actually: he was always calm on the court (my favorite Knick) and as I recall he couldn't make free throws too well.  I liked his style of coaching.  He was more animated than I ever saw as a player. He needs some new and better players. I'll bet he'll be able to recruit.

A recent NY Times piece noted the proliferation of child pornography on the web and the absence of sufficient resources allocated to stomping out this problem.

But how much money comes in from sources that, if we looked, would be deemed institutionally unacceptable?   2.  Cozying up to donors is a big part of fundraising.  So didn\u2019t these institutions meet and stay in touch w/ Epstein?  Harvard said it isn\u2019t returning the $$ it got. Is that because it was received before convictions? Didn\u2019t Harvard send updates/reports to him?  Couldn\u2019t Harvard show some grace and donate an identical amount to fund for his victims?  Ok: just return it. 3.  Wouldn\u2019t it be easy to fool a college/university as to a donation\u2019s source? Just create layers. Now ask: Is Sackler money being returned or just new $$ not bring taken by educational institutions? I\u2019d say we need to do more thinking about donor source.

Were I stationed there, I would learn their language \u2014 not only to navigate but to show respect.  Not just hello and goodbye.   3.  The local Okinawa crafts, found in hidden places on the island, represent amazing artisans, many of whom are not frequented by Americans.  Americans tend to go to \u201ctouristy\u201d places, theme parks with fake crafts.  It is different to see weavers weaving and smell the wet clay and see the glass blowers blowing.

Also, given the starvation and deaths of children across the globe, it is worth pausing and reflecting on what we can do to improve the lives of the next generation -- near and far. There is homelessness and food scarcity in many areas -- hidden and not so hidden poverty and a deep inequality for children in education too. That gets me to my next point: I will be at Molly Stark School in VT (which is I believe close to 100% free and reduced lunch) on June 3 to read and work with children.

And, new leaders, this is hard and I know from experience and my own errors: you can only blame your predecessor and institutional bad acts for so long.  Once one gets the lay of the land, a leader owns the institution's past. Ownership is key to trustworthiness, the ability to live with oneself and to take real action.  Blame gets you nowhere. Why do I raise this now? With all the institutions struggling with one crisis or another, particularly in education, we can see the value of being forthright.  Stand up and own what went/is wrong. And, then take the steps needed to remedy the situation. Think Georgetown owning its slave past. Remarkable. Think Penn State not owning its silence. Troubling.  And, by the by, PR folks would agree: It's best for institutions moving forward if their leaders step forward.  Remember the President of Columbia who climbed out his office window to avoid student protesters? As they say in the law, res ipsa.  #presidency   #leadership   #crises       \u2026see more"}

Suppose he indicated that, given his background, he was overtaken by the freedoms before him and drank and partied too much and in over-the-top ways. He was like an unstuck drawer. As he's matured, he has seen how his behavior was misguided (how much vomiting does one need to experience), and he hopes that his own children can grow up in a way that does not require that level of rebellion to find their way.   Now assuming no sexual assaults in this period (a huge leap of faith for me as I believe the victims), he would not have lied. He wouldn't have had former classmates crawling out of the walls; he wouldn't have had his yrbk words to defend; he wouldn't have done a FOX interview (when winning, silence is better; when offense is weak, put up a loud defense). He wouldn't be discussing his virginity (or anything close to intercourse), and he would have been honest. I repeat: he would have been honest. Painting oneself as a saint is a surefire method for people coming to destroy that image. Who's a saint after all? Once you lie, the lies keep growing. That's, sadly, the story of a lying nominee.

We plow fields not people. I get the rush but do we do justice by rushing to find truth? One more thought:  Youthful indiscretion is not rare. What is bad here is: failure to own one's past; failure to apologize; lying. The Justices decide about real people; truth matters.  Truly matters.  So does integrity.  So does honesty.  Judge Kavanaugh is not being criminally charged (too late); but he bears burden of persuasion.  This isn't about innocent until proven guilty in a criminal trial. There is no trial.

(2) Are their graduates better for having attended and graduated (and even those who stopped out, are they better for the experience)? and (3) If not small colleges, where?    Ponder these questions/answers. Small colleges, non-elite small colleges, help many first generation, Pell eligible students find their way.  That's powerful in and of itself.  Small colleges have faculty who actually teach, and teaching and pedagogy matter to them.  Small colleges produce people who help make the world go round: police officers, nurses, community based workers, social workers, teachers, small entrepreneurs, radiology techs, healthcare advocates, coaches.\u00a0 Returning to the article: You bet there is a place for small colleges.

So do traditions that encourage bad behavior. Look at Prep Schools as exemplars. 2nd, the \"hands-off\" leaders have real trouble; it's good to delegate but....And, there needs to be a culture of transparency and an overt culture where bad news can and must be shared, not buried. 3rd, there are rose colored glasses as in: this too will pass. Nope. It won't. 4th, much of the training is poor, and people resent needing training suggesting they know all the issues. Reform the training. Bring in outsiders to do it and make it worth the faculty, staff, coaches and administrators' time. Poor training leads to poor outcomes. And resentment about waste of time. 5th, how we handle crises when they occur on campuses is weak and needs reformation. We make things worse, not better, because we aren't experts. Bring them in. 6th, to return to my favorite topic: Ask this. If there were co-presidents, could all this happen as it did on all these campuses? Speculating yes.

What a romantic notion --- a tradition I never knew about and one that seemed so so warm and loving.  My dad passed away in 2008 and my mom recently remarked that she had not danced at night since then and missed my dad and dancing. She is now 89.  So, I recruited my partner and he agreed to dance with my mom this week-end --- rug rolled up, drink in background and old fashioned music. Tradition revived for a night.  A gift to my mom and one amazing partner I have who is willing to allow time to stop for just a moment to remember the past and create a memory.  Thanks MW.       \u2026see more"}

Were I to institute a look-see at Princeton, I would look at culture first -- what is it in the culture that enables men to seek and thrive in leadership posts.

Give us a feeling you know what the company does, and how it relates to YOU. Be Polite. Mention any special ability you have that\u2019s relevant. I\u2019m always looking for a candidate with an edge.  End your message with a Call To Action. A simple \u2018best regards\u2019 isn\u2019t enough.  #DON \u2019T: Use templates. I spot them immediately. Command us to do anything. You don\u2019t work for me, I don\u2019t work for you. Not yet at least :-) Ask us what we have to offer you. This is about offering yourself, not the opposite. Finding a job IS a job. Make the effort.   #hr   #people   #linkedin       \u2026see more"}
{"instruction": "Write a post about optimizing search results on LinkedIn. Share tips on how to appear in relevant searches and include examples of successful strategies.", "output": "Have you clicked on the Search Appearances feature on your profile? \ud83e\udd14 You get this notification weekly, some of you ignore it while I suggest taking a deeper look.  On your LinkedIn profile, you\u2019ll see the number of searches you appeared in.  Clicking on them gives you some handy insights. Where it shows the job-titles of the people, this indicates if you reach the right audience. Take a look at whose search you appeared in and see if those are the kinds of searches you want to be showing up in. If the people you are appearing to are unrelated to your field I would recommend seeing if you could make some adjustments to your profile to better align with the searches you want to show up in. As you can see, in my case: \ud83d\udcccPeople from AppsFlyer search my profile- Hi guys you can reach out to me over slack although I'm more available here\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\udcccMost of the people work as SW developers- which is good for me because this is the audience I'm looking to hire. \ud83d\udcccThe keywords people search for Sourcer, Recruiter, HR, and Talent are also amazing for me because this is the kind of words I want people to search and find me. So, take a deeper look and try to learn and improve. This is a great QA to your profile. I think a good number should be 300-500 searches\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc #linkedin   #jobs       \u2026see more"}

You are your own brand! If you are a brand you should emphasize your professional skills by sharing interesting content and showing interesting projects.

Open the \"let recruiters know you are open to new opportunity button\", it's discreet and won't show up to recruiters at your company. And yes, marketing-wise it looks much better.

{"instruction": "Can you create a post on LinkedIn sharing some industry insights based on recent data? Maybe something related to the impact of remote work on employee productivity or job satisfaction?", "output": "Let's talk DATA! I have exciting data about the industry, 3-months post corona. I will give my insights. The basis for the information is from  AdviceMe.Il   so of course, you can not generalize it to all populations. Nevertheless it's interesting. First - the average age of people who asked for our advice: 26-33. I can explain it mostly by experience, 26-33 usually are employees at the beginning of their careers, and companies prefer to keep the seniors because they're more expensive to hire and of course, more valuable. Second, 1 out of 5 people is a software developer! Well, I was amazed by this one. I would think that SW people who are in high demand would be the last to get fired. I can explain it with 2 ideas - first, most of them are juniors /from small startups that had to close, second, AdviceMe's branding was especially oriented for tech people. Another interesting piece of data- 80% of the people who asked for our advice had at least an undergrad degree. The higher education was the fewer people there were. I guess companies won't let go so fast of people with high education. Also, 90% of people with 3rd degree had a managerial experience which is not a surprise.

After some research on my side, I can tell that things are gonna change. Here are the new 4 key factors that will be considered in the post-corona era: **Financial stability of the company (the company fired staff during corona, or sent employees to unpaid leave) **Work-life balance (did the company take into consideration work hours for employees with kids, WFH)  **Social responsibility (companies that helped during the corona with donations, volunteering, and technology)  **A place to stay for the long term (according to salary, perks, and people).

Here's why?    1) Facebook acknowledge the gaps and plans to solve many of the issues such as communication & creativity through building tools & technologies.   2) Facebook plans to offer remote work to more experienced employees vs. newly graduates who need more mentoring and structure.   3) It offers Remote Work option to majority of current and future employees, but acknowledges that some roles can't be remote. It's critical to be honest and open about these types of limitations. 4) Facebook's strategy came across as data driven & feedback-driven -- based on the survey results from employees.  5) Facebook officially took a stand which enables it to establish leadership in this movement. Its decisive yet conservative approach came across as more well though out.  What do you think? #remotework   #workfromhome   #flexiblework   #futureofwork       \u2026see more"}

The Gates Foundation, Wellcome & Mastercard are committing $125M in funding to companies developing treatments for the coronavirus.  4) Many companies that haven't been fully prepared to support  #WorkFromHome  needed to move to that direction. 5) Despite \"social distancing,\" the deep human connections will get stronger & our communities will hopefully continue get tighter.

He was the Global Head of TMT, Citi Investment Banking, where I did my very first internship & then my 1st full-time job. He noticed me from the get go and connoted with me at a personal level. Through many years, he continued to be my advisor & sounding board in many big personal & professional decisions. Watching Chris in action as one of the top leaders at Citi & one of the most respected investors on the Street & in the world, taught me fundamental leadership lessons that I carried through my life:  1) As a leader, you should always keep calm & be in control of your emotions even during the most challenging times & while delivering tough news such as economic downturn of 2008 or a key executive\u2019s departure. Teams will pick the leader\u2019s emotions, which can help them to stay focused and confident or lose it all together. 2) Be intellectually curious. Get to know others on a personal level & always stay fun and interesting, so others care to get to know you.  3) Speak less, smile more & listen attentively. That way, when you talk and provide a point of view there\u2019s a lot more receptivity for it.  Thanks Chris!

With less than 1% of Fortune 500 CEOs being Black (3 out of 500 to be exact) and only 3.2% of the senior leadership roles at large companies in the U.S. being Black, we need to change our perspectives to hiring, promoting, and empowering people of different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders.

Wearing different hats every day as an executive, mom, wife, university lecturer, startup advisor & investor, public speaker, daughter, sister, and friend left me absolutely no time for myself.  As someone who researched mental health and the benefits of meditation closely, I know that committing to do 5-10 minutes of meditation every day will bring me the focus, calm, and clearance of mind that I need and make me more effective in everything I do. So my new year resolution is to get back to daily meditation. I want to invite you all to join me in this journey and share your experiences with me throughout the year. These are some tips on how to get started:  1) Allocate the same time every day to meditate. Ideally you meditate after an existing routine (e.g. right after you wake up). That\u2019s the best way to build a habit. 2) Set a reminder.  3) Use one of the meditation apps - Calm or Headspace.   #health   #wellness   #meditation   #newyearresolution       \u2026see more"}

This battle combatant is a wildly contagious disease called COVID-19. Doctors, nurses, aides, medical techs, clerks, environmental service workers feel threatened for their lives by just doing their jobs. And it is not clear if Americans really appreciate the level of risk, exposure and selflessness that all medical workers do for all of us. When I worked in a busy inner-city ER, I felt rushed, stressed and at times, worried for my safety: every now and then, some patient would come after a nurse or doctor with a knife or gun. But in comparison to treating patients with COVID? No comparison\u2014treating patients with a highly contagious disease and with patients that are really ill, is way, way harder. My heart goes out to all healthcare workers.  The way we can support healthcare workers is by masking-up and keeping our distance. Selected Except: \u201cWe put on our masks and come to work every day because we don\u2019t have the luxury of working from home in our pajamas, but the apathy and ennui that\u2019s taken hold of society just makes our job feel thankless.

Me? I love it and giggle at the thought of how many healthcare providers and hospital systems will be annoyed because 'these companies are trying to practice medicine.' And, incidentally might migrate patients away from them.... But that's NOT why I love it--I love this because healthcare insiders won't change and the change must come from outsiders...and Lord knows, we need change--if it's an improvement ... because we all know that not all change is an improvement , but all improvement requires change!       \u2026see more"}

So I will give the same advice to Amazon as  I give to the companies I speak to which is this: building a new--and better--technology or service is NOT enough to cause disruption. (Who doesn't feel they have built a better mousetrap ?) What successful organizations do is realize that  new \"things\" or ideas need to be adopted... which requires dealing with the age-old (and not super sexy) change management...working with and through people and politics.  Trust me Amazon: people make or break the best of ideas--especially in complex organizations like clinical healthcare settings.

And that's the rub... making sure such checklists and protocols are routinely used by everyone and not allowing \"more senior\" doctors or nurses to ignore them.

We adopted her. Her name is Charlie and she has been a total delight. As a huge animal rights person,  II think the \"no-kill\" shelters do a great job and would rather see an unwanted dog or cat go there than abandoned in the street....

And sure, I know (I know!), healthcare is not like package delivery. But let's face it-many aspects of care delivery is about delivering the correct good or service to the right person/patient, at the right time. It is also about caring and doing the right thing. And while individual healthcare providers do the right thing all the time, the collective effort of the health care enterprise routinely fails  to deliver the right service at the right time to the right person in a customer-service orientation .

Let me ask--how was your 3 year old son supposed to get better without the help of  trained health care professionals ? What bothers me in so many of these healthcare posts is an undying sense of pettiness, and disregard for people's medical problems... wether that disregard is coming from insurance providers or the public.  Healthcare should be held above  all other industries to be caring, loving and selfless.

Wasting people's time is what 'slow learning' organizations do best and will cost them patient loyalty.  The lay public cannot decipher between \"great\" medical care and \"ok\" medical care so they will assess \"goodness\" by efficiently, and 'customer service.'...

I worked as an ER nurse doing all functions including triage, running the code ... Here's what I suggest: don't go to the ER unless you are acutely ill--as in having fallen off a ladder and you broke a bone, or feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest because the pain is so bad, or you are vomiting and can't stop--stuff like this!! Too often when you call doctors /nurses with a problem, they offer to see you in their office or tell you to go to the ER...

In the upcoming month, I\u2019ll share with you one question from my book each week and provide a short (but sweet) answer. Question 4: Is Printing Out Medical Equipment Cheaper Than Manufacturing?  In short: YES. And not only that, it\u2019s much more customizable. 3D printing works by additive manufacturing, which means that a digital model is created of the object we want to print out, and the machine adds each layer one at a time. That way, a personalized, 3D printed cast could get ready in 2 minutes and would cost around $50.  Wealthy companies will turn to 3D printing because of its potential for total customization. Companies in poorer regions will turn to it because it makes prototypes inexpensively.

The superiority of salience reflects a growing awareness that, in the age of Trump, what people think of you is far less important than the more brutal objective of getting people to think about you.\" I agree with that. And, this: \"We overthought things and made the cardinal error of assuming brands were as big for consumers as they were for us marketers... We need to calm down. We need to take more risks.\" Someone once said this, maybe I dreamt it: Everything is marketing, but  #marketing  isn't everything.

Feldman  to grow a data services brand in a then-emerging  #B2B   #martech  space.  There were only ~100 tools on the map as  #demandgen  teams bought our prospect lists to fuel email/call blitzes.  Some did it well, others simply spammed the living daylights out of those CSV files. Today, not much has changed, and yet, everything is different. Over a decade later, even with 10x more tools, the task of acquiring contacts still threatens to derail even the best laid plans - but this time, it's  #ABM  at risk.  Why can't teams find the right contacts for accounts? Why don't more demand gen pros think in an account-based way, like Sales? Are we ever going to shake our MQL-based ethos? Mark is now the head of revenue operations at Localytics, and I've asked him back for a reunion with me live this Friday at 1:00pm ET for a conversation about how things have changed in 10 years, and today, how to solve this new (but old) ABM data problem.

The evolving environment we find ourselves in presents new challenges and opportunities to be even more relevant and useful for clients. While some companies may be distracted or paused in some of their efforts to find solutions, that only means marketing needs to do a better job of providing best answer content in formats that are relevant in the new environment: virtual events, video conferencing, podcasts, webinars, interactive content, recorded video, live streaming and other forms of online engagement. Virtual reality or direct mail are considerations as well. During this time of transition, it\u2019s also important that marketers review their planned advertising, social and marketing messages to be appropriate to what customers are dealing with right now.

A reminder as you experience, celebrate, or share these ads: Women don\u2019t need to be pandered to.  Are we really fooled by faux-feminist marketing? For some women, yes. We're so used to the objectification of women in advertising (see all of  Jean Kilbourne 's work) that anything that resembles girl-power is celebrated. But I believe we need to raise our standards. The struggle of pay inequality, workplace sexual harassment and other forms of gender discrimination is not just another trend to exploit in order to gain eyeballs and trust. In a perfect world, brands and their agencies would stop trying to make a buck on the backs of those who have worked to create real change.  As much as I appreciate the intention, at the end of the day most companies deploying  #IWD  campaigns are simply bandwagoning with the global women's rights movement.  They exploit a narrative to achieve a common goal: Sell more product. Differentiate. Earn trust.  Most are not even held to the most basic standards of practicing what they preach internally, or within their industry.

Whether you\u2019re an individual or a corporation, your brand is what distinguishes you from all other lookalike options, and defines your place in the world.  2. A brand is a promise.  Branding goes deeper than colors, font, logos, or a headshot. It\u2019s a promise you make to the world; this is the kind of experience you will have with me.  Live up to that promise, consistently. 3. Perception is reality.  Marketing, at its core, is about changing perception. Building a personal brand is about being thoughtful about the perception the world has about you.  Use it to get you where you want to go, not to satisfy your ego. Clarify your end-game. 4. Ask for three words. If you\u2019re stuck defining yourself in a pithy way (it\u2019s not easy) ask friends and colleagues to describe you in three words.  Look for patterns.  5. Be yourself. Don\u2019t try to be the person you think you should be. Have confidence in what you bring to the table. Your best brand strengths come from what differentiates you.
